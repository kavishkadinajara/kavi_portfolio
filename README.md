This is the source code for my personal website, [kavishkadinajara.com](https://kavishkadinajara.com/), where I showcase my projects, skills, and blog posts. It is built with [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that provides powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. The website also uses [Next UI](https://nextui.org/), a beautiful, fast, and modern React UI library for a stunning design, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
